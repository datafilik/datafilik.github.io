title: FOSTMusings - Finding open source solutions for the developing World

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hey buddy! Welcome to FOSTMusings.</h1>
	<p>
		Adoption of new technologies have generally been the way society makes  progress.
	</p> 
	
	<p>
		What is powerful about adopting technology innovation early on, is that it has the potential to give 
		early adopters a leg-up on established interests. Where the early adopters are driven by good and altruistic 
		intent and the establishment are problematic or simply turned bad, this becomes a plausible way to make 
		change for the good and progress for society.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In the above spirit, FOSTMusings would be a documentation of adventures into Free and Open Source 
		Technologies (FOST) with the purpose of <em>identifying applications for specific problems, particularly 
		in the developing world</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why focus on FOSTs? Well first, there are free and have an army of actors with different perspectives, actively 
		contributing and developing their core. Secondly, when widely adopted, they usually become the standard.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Adopting FOSTs and innovating on them, is potentially a way to emulate Japan and the Asian tigers to drive 
		progress in the developing world.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		FOSTMusings focus hence is to drive adoption of FOSTs, where possible, to solve problems in the developing 
		world.
