It is 1.00PM. Pascal had just woken up from an afternoon nap to the heat and still quite house, indicative of the absense 
of electric power, which had, in the first place, made him to take the power-absence induced afternoon nap. He had been 
working on one of his pet web development projects when suddenly, a power outage occurred. The charged battery of his laptop had bought him an additional one hour before it ran out of charge. Here he was awoken by the heat, that seemed to have increased in its intensity, and yet the electric power haddn't been restored.

Sudden power outages are normal occurrence in his area of sub-Saharan Africa, But the duration of power outage during the current week had be especially long and almost looked like the would last forever. 

'What could be the cause of the outage this time', he reasoned, trying to give himself possible rough estimates of the outage duration and maybe some assurrance of a not-too-far time when the electric power is restored. 

'Could it be delibrate a outage for his area due to power rationing, or did some breaker switch trip due to power surge', He thought. Contnuing his train of thought he reasoned, 'Had the transformer for the line supplying his house, blown or was there a much bigger issue at the power sub-station supplying his township'. this were typical scenarios that played out in Pascal's mind each time a power outage occured. he had just completed his 1-year mandatory national service and was at his parent's place trying to work out what to do next.

The almost constant stream of start-up success stories from Sillicon Valley in the US and the dramatic ways the lives of once cash-strapped individuals changed, once their business idea took off, convinced him that building a Start-up was the next thing. Who could resist the urge of bring one's own boss. True to this conviction, he had been working on a website which he began to developed at his spare times during his national service days. he had had to make significant payements for interconnection from his national carrier plus he had to enduure the periods of electric power outage. the combination of the two factors had hindered much progress in the  project. Sometimes he loses motivation when he delibrates on what use it was to develope a website for potential end-users who would have to grapple with high internet connection cost and frequent power  outage.

he had spent the first few waking moments lost in thought and then it occurred it occured to him, 'Why do we have so much irradiation from the Sun and so much heat and yet no electric power?' this was a really important question he felt he should answer. the Sun for most part of the day through out the year in sub-Saharan Africa and yet his township faced power outages almost every day. 

He thought to himself, 'I have to find a way to utlize this readilly avaialble energy of the sun'. He once had an internship at a solar power company and was aware that a key drawback to solar power deployment was the cost and reliability of batteries as well as maintenance of the unweldy system. Having concluded that one had to explore off-grid power solutions, especially given the readily available nature of sunlight in Sub_saharan Africa, he had to go to work on designing a solar power generation system that  could deployed in homes. 

Gasoline generators had become the way to cope with the epilleptic power outages inspite of their noisey and polluting nature. There had become so valuable as would be clear from stories sround the country of individuals having to chain down their generator unit to avert the possibility of it been stolen when operated outdoor during an outage. Yet this was in a country that had adundant sunlight for most part of the day each year. He had to develope a solar power system to effectively out-compete the potable but noisey gasoline power generators.
